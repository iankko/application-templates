When deploying RH-SSO application template, *_SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME_* and *_SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD_* parameters denote the user name and password of the Red Hat Single Sign-On serverâ€™s administrator account to be created for the _master_ realm.

*Both of these parameters are required.* If not specified, they are auto generated and displayed as an OpenShift Instructional message when the template is instantiated.
